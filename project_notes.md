# Project Example Idea 2
(Build a site to sell your graphic design services)

# External userâ€™s goal:
(Users are able to purchase graphical designs to address their needs)

# Site owner's goal:
(Earn money for doing freelance design work)

# Potential features to include:
Showcase prior work for clients, based on different kinds of requests, and the customer's testimonials.

Allow users to order a particular graphic to suit their goals. 
The user would fill out a form describing their needs, 
including fields such as 
type (e.g. icon, logo, poster), 
size and description, 
get an automatic quote 
and then pay. 

You may want to include a javascript calculator to display a preview of the quote, 
but make sure that the final price is determined on the server, 
and cannot be manipulated directly by the user.

The site owner, 
logging in as a special user, 
would be able to see a list of all orders, 
and then upload their completed work 
which would be made available to the customer.

# Advanced potential feature (nice-to-have)
The customer then has the option to either 
accept the result, or 
request a round of changes.

Once the customer accepts, 
they would write a testimonial and the final graphic would be automatically included in the site's showcase.

Build a custom js display mechanism for the gallery page - e.g. your own unique kind of carousel.
